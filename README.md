This is project for GNU/Linux type operating systems about GC content in different Yeast strains.
In this project consists of basic shell scripts finding open reading frames,
calculating GC ratios and R script which draws histograms.
All results are presented with latex report and slides which are produced automatically by Makefile when only fasta files of yeasts are given.
